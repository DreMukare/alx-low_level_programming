#  0x03. C - Debugging

## Multiple mains

**Test that function `postive_or_negative()` gives correct output when given case with 0.**

> Only change one line of code

```
i = 0;
```

## Like, comment, subscribe

**Comment out part of code that is causing infinite loop.**

```
/*
* while (i < 10)
* {
*       putchar(i);
* }
*/
```

## 0 > 972?

**Fix `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out largest number no matter the case**

## Leap year

**Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.**

> - assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31). 
> - assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
