# 0x04 - More functions, more nested loops

This directory explores more functions and nested loops in C. 

## 0.isupper

**Checks for uppercase characters**

> - Returns 1 if c is uppercase
> - Returns 0 otherwise

## 1.isdigit

**Checks for digit (0 through 9)**

> - Returns 1 if c is a digit
> - Returns 0 otherwise

## 2.Collaboration is multiplication

**Multiplies two integers**

## 3.The numbers speak for themselves

**Prints the numbers 0 to 9 followed by a new line**

> - can only use `_putchar` twice in code

## 4.I believe in numbers and signs

**Prints the numbers from 0 to 9 followed by a new line**

> - Do not print 2 and 4 
> - Can only use `_putchar` twice in your code

## 5.Numbers constitute the only universal language

**Prints ten times the numbers from 0 to 14 followed by a new line**

> - Can only use `_putchar` three times

## 6.The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

**Draws a straight line in the terminal**

> - Can only use `_putchar`
> - n is the number of times `_` should be printed
> - Line should end with `\n`
> - If n is 0 or less print only `\n`

## 7.I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

**Draws a diagonal line on the terminal**

> - Can only use `_putchar`
> - n is the number of times `\` should be printed
> - Diagonal line should end with `\n`
> - If n is 0 or less print only `\n`

## 8.You are so much sunshine in every square inch

**Prints a square followed by a new line**

> - Can only use `_putchar`
> - `size` is the size of the square
> - If `size` is 0 or less print only `\n`
> - Use `#` to print the square

## 9.Fizz-Buzz

**Print numbers from 1 to 100 followed by a new line. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz**

> - Each number or word should be separated by a space
> - Allowed to use standard library 

## 10.Triangles

**Prints a triangle followed by a new line**

> - Can only use `_putchar`
> - `size` is the size of the triangle
> - If `size` is 0 or less print only `\n`
> - Use `#` to print the triangle
